# Customer-Churn

This project analyzes customer behavior to identify key factors contributing to churn and builds a predictive model to classify customers at risk of leaving. Using a combination of SQL, Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn), and Tableau, the project demonstrates a full end-to-end data workflow from extraction to visualization.

The goal is to help businesses better understand churn drivers and take proactive steps to retain valuable customers.
